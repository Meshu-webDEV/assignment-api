#### Description:
Write a javascript application, Your code needs to be easy to understand, easy to maintain and follow a logic you could explain. It also has to show what you are capable of.  We will not just be checking the output but how you code, how you use your libraries. You need to think about things that should not be allowed like two accounts with the same login etc. Treat this as if it's a project for a client. We are very particular with the quality of code/coding practices (Would suggest you include test cases and follow MVC architecture) and treat it as it will be used on a production server so please apply security measures and other things that should be added/removed on the code when deploying on a production server.  

#### Assignment objectives:
1. The application can start with only two commands: npm install and npm start
2. The application has a system of authentication. I need to be able to register and I need
to be able to log in.
3. The application has a call allowing a registered user only to see all the users created.


#### Technologies  to consider:

- Node.js
- Express
